##Abstract.
In the new technological era, facial recognition has become a central issue for a great
number of engineers. Currently, there are a great number of techniques for facial recognition, but
in this research, we focus on the use of deep learning. The problems with current facial
recognition convection systems are that they are developed in non-mobile devices. This research
intends to develop a Facial Recognition System implemented in an unmanned aerial vehicle of the
quadcopter type. While it is true, there are quadcopters capable of detecting faces and/or shapes
and following them, but most are for fun and entertainment. This research focuses on the facial
recognition of people with criminal records, for which a neural network is trained. The Caffe
framework is used for the training of a convolutional neural network. The system is developed on
the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 motherboard. The design and construction of the quadcopter are done
from scratch because we need the UAV for adapt to our requirements. This research aims to
reduce violence and crime in Latin America.
